Title: I built a site that auto-curates daily tech deals from Amazon, Best Buy, eBay & more

Body:
Hey everyone, I built **Tech and More** — it's a simple deal aggregator that scrapes the best tech, home, and gadget deals daily.

Deals are categorized (Tech/Home/Beauty), and updated automatically every morning. It pulls from Slickdeals, DealNews, and direct retailer feeds.

Free to use, no signup needed. Just bookmark it and check back daily.

Would love any feedback or suggestions for more deal sources!
